                <h2>Rio de Janeiro</h2>
                <h3>
                    Blessed by nature and infused with an unshakeable samba spirit, Rio de Janeiro is at
                    once intoxicatingly beautiful and thrillingly alive. Here’s why you need to get there now...
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Lauded in song, with names redolent with sun and sophisticated, Rio’s beaches are
                    famous around the world. <strong>Praia</strong> de Copacabana, perhaps the most famous, stretches from
                    the Morro do Leme hill in the northeast to the Arpoador rocks in the southwest, a lively
                    stretch of sand where almost anything goes.  Ipanema, in one of the city’s wealthiest
                    neighbourhoods offers an altogether more sophisticated experience, with its chic boutiques
                    and glamorous restaurants.
                    Praia Vermelha, at the base of Sugarloaf mountain, offers a more rustic beachside
                    experience. Backed by the iconic mountain, dotted with colonial architecture and mature
                    trees, this stretch of sand is a reminder of times past, where boys fish from rocks and
                    families picnic in the shade.

                <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s never been a better time to take care of yourself. If you’re ready to get away
                    and revitalise your mind, body and soul in an eco-friendly paradise, Costa Rica has to
                    be on your list. You’ll get back to nature with jungle explorations, wildlife encounters,
                    volcano treks and plenty of beach time. Plus you’ll get to meet inspiring locals from
                    organic farmers to wildlife conservationists. Sustainable travel will be one of the
                    biggest travel trends, so get ahead and start organising your Costa Rica trip.

                <p>
                    This opulent city-state is the perfect place for a stopover or a longer holiday. Plus
                    Singapore had one of the most effective responses to the pandemic, making it a safer
                    option for 2022 travel.

                <h2>Canada</h2>
                <p>
                    Spending time in nature is good for your mental and physical wellbeing… And there are
                    few nicer places to get outdoors than Canada. As soon as you set eyes on the snow-white
                    peaks of the Canadian Rockies and the emerald lakes of Banff and Jasper National Parks,
                    you’ll fall in love all over again with our magnificent planet. Take a ride across the
                    Athabasca Glacier, journey through breath-taking scenery on the Rocky Mountaineer train,
                    or learn about the customs of the country’s indigenous people.

                <h2>New Zealand</h2>
                <p>
                    New Zealand is the country that brought Middle-earth to life. Across the country,
                    you'll find spots that were featured in scenes of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit
                    trilogies. You'll also be able to explore actual Hobbit houses that were used during
                    filming, and the cutting-edge studios in Wellington that were central to film production.
                    New Zealand is full of beautiful lakes. Setting the scene for many iconic road trips, follow
                    the famous lakeside highways that provide postcard-worthy views at every turn. Make sure you
                    include Lake Tekapo and the impressive Lake Pukaki on your itinerary. If you’re visiting
                    Wanaka, a short drive to Lake Hawea will not disappoint.

                    edge of plunging fjords and world-class train journeys winding through lush mountains.
                    Think lavish palaces dripping in royal history, and stylish cities packed with all the
                    best boutiques, bars and restaurants. From Sweden, Norway and Denmark, to Finland and
                    Iceland, it’s time to go Nordic on your 2022 travels.
